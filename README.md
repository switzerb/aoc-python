# Advent of Code (Python)

I've used the puzzles in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to learn new languages and coding techniques over
the years. As my coding has evolved, I've come back to the same puzzles in different languages, trying to understand how
the different languages work and move my understanding of engineering forward. The puzzles are nearly ideal for this
type of work since they are complex enough to really *use* the language features, fun enough to keep me coming back even
when I am tired after a day of work, and simple enough that they aren't hampered by all the frameworks, ecosystem and
platform problems that come along with trying to build a full application in a new language.

This particular repository has code written in Python. It's somewhat bad form to be publishing these to the web, input
included, since I don't want to diminish anyone else's enjoyment of the puzzles. However, all of the puzzles are safely
in the past and rest assured that I have never made it on a leaderboard -- if you are looking for hints and tips and
cheats, there are FAR better coders out there who have published their code.

There is also the [Reddit board](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) which is almost as good as solving a puzzle
yourself. I am constantly amazed at the cleverness of coders.

There are no instructions in this README to run the code since I'm assuming that running *my* puzzle input has no value.
But feel free to check it out and if you have comments or suggestions, I'm always game to learn something new.
